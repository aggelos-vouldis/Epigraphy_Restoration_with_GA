# Creating and Testing a Genetic Algorithm for Epigraphy Restoration

This application is developed in the context of the second project for the "Computational Complexity" course

## Technologies used:

- python3
- jupyter notebook / lab

## Description

This project aims to develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to restore ancient epigraphs with missing or damaged text. The goal is to fill in the gaps in these historical inscriptions by leveraging the similarity in content and structure with other epigraphs from the same geographic region.

## Files Explanation

- data 📁
    - iphi2802.csv -> the actual data from which we are getting our dictionary and our inscriptions 
- exports 📁
    - *.log -> Actual results of all tests made (each files name is build like: "PS_population size_CR_cross rate_MR_mutation rate")
